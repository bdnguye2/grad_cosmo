# COSMO
Addressing the research question: Is the outlying charge error 
significant in the gradient calculations? Is the outlying charge 
correction enough to remedy the issue?

TODO: Develop a set of molecules to test the error
TODO: Decide on the COSMO parameters to test
TODO: Compute the outlying charge error
