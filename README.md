# COSMO
Addressing the research question: Is the outlying charge error 
significant in the gradient calculations? Is the outlying charge 
correction enough to remedy the issue?

TODO: Develop a set of molecules to test the error (Jenny and Matthew)
+Made a directory called benchmark with a file for unoptimized anions
containing both small(less than 50 atoms) and large(bigger than 50 atoms)
 anions

TODO: Decide on the COSMO parameters to test (Matthew)
TODO: Compute the outlying charge error (Jenny and Matthew)
